  <p class="handNote">
    When I hug you, everything feels safe. <br>
    Your arms make the world quiet, my heart calm, and my worries disappear. <br>
    In that moment, I feel comfortable, loved, and completely at home. <br>
    You don’t just hold me — you heal me. <br>
    I never want to let go of a place that feels this right.
